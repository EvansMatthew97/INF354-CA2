Each group displays a subtotal, and lists the products in descending order of total sales to show the user the best selling and worst selling products at opposite ends of the spectrum.
4) Why will this report be useful?
	This report allows the user to view sales for a certain time range and determine which types of products and brands make the most and least sales, allowing the business to prioritise stocking more profitable products and stop stocking those which do not get sold.
